### Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r Scatterplots}
library(ggplot2)
pf <- read.csv("pseudo_facebook.tsv", sep="\t")

qplot(x = age, y = friend_count, data = pf)

```

***

#### What are some things that you notice right away?
Response:
That the distribution of the data isn't normal.
It appears that a lot of data are on the left and right of the chart.
And there's also a spike of friends count for users who is around 70 years old.
***

### ggplot Syntax
Notes:
1. http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/
1. http://bbs.ceb-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/handout_ggplot2.pdf

```{r ggplot Syntax}
ggplot(data =pf, aes(x= age, y= friend_count)) +
    geom_point() + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(13,90, 2), limits = c(13,90))

summary(pf$age)

```

***

### Overplotting
Notes:
1. http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html

```{r Overplotting}
# it will take twenty friend count to get a dark dot
ggplot(data = pf, aes(x=age, y=friend_count)) + 
    geom_jitter(alpha=1/20) +
    xlim(13, 90)

```

#### What do you notice in the plot?
Response:
That the data is a bit more spread out now.
There's still a high concentration of  younger users with high friends  count which seems normal.
The users that are roughly 70 years old have  have a common friends count of less than 1500. And those that have a friend count of more than 1,500 isn't that common.
***

### Coord_trans()
Notes:
1. http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_trans.html

```{r Coord_trans()}

```

#### Look up the documentation for coord_trans() and add a layer to the plot that transforms friend_count using the square root function. Create your plot!

```{r}
ggplot(data = pf, aes(x=age, y=friend_count)) + 
    geom_jitter(alpha=1/20, position=position_jitter(h = 0)) +
    xlim(13, 90) +
    coord_trans(y="sqrt")

ggplot(data = pf, aes(x=age, y=friend_count)) + 
    geom_point(alpha=1/20) +
    xlim(13, 90) +
    coord_trans(y="sqrt")

```

#### What do you notice?
That the values are mo spread out for users below the age of 25.
By sqrt the y, it makes the users with a friend count of below 1000 easier to spot.
***

### Alpha and Jitter
Notes:
1. http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/position_jitter.html

```{r Alpha and Jitter}
# This programming assignment
# will not be graded, but when you
# submit your code, the assignment
# will be marked as correct. By submitting
# your code, we can add to the feedback
# messages and address common mistakes
# in the Instructor Notes.

# You can assess your work by watching
# the solution video.


# Examine the relationship between
# friendships_initiated (y) and age (x)
# using the ggplot syntax.
ggplot(data= pf, aes(x =age, y=friendships_initiated)) +
    geom_point(show.legend = T) 

# We recommend creating a basic scatter
# plot first to see what the distribution looks like.
# and then adjusting it by adding one layer at a time.
ggplot(data= pf, aes(x =age, y=friendships_initiated)) +
    geom_jitter(show.legend = T, alpha = 1/20) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(13,90, 2), limits = c(13,90))

ggplot(data= pf, aes(x =age, y=friendships_initiated)) +
    geom_jitter(show.legend = T, alpha = 1/20, position = position_jitter(h=0)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(13,90, 2), limits = c(13,90)) +
    coord_trans(y = "sqrt")

# What are your observations about your final plot?
#1. Resemble the friend count's plot, which we see a high number of users with friends count which are below the age of 25.
#1. We also see the similar spike for the user around the age of 68.
#1. There appears to be more users who are above the age of 73 that doesn't have low friendship initiated count.

# Remember to make adjustments to the breaks
# of the x-axis and to use apply alpha and jitter.

# ENTER ALL OF YOUR CODE FOR YOUR PLOT BELOW THIS LINE.

## an alternative way to get this done
pf.fc_by_age <- pf %>%
    group_by(age) %>%
    summarise(fc_mean = mean(friend_count),
              fc_median = median(friend_count),

    geom_line(stat="summary", fun.y= quantile, fun.args = list(probs=.9), linetype=2, color="orange")
```

#### What are some of your observations of the plot?
Response:
1. Most users have less than 250 friends.
1. The upper fifty percent have a wider range of friends. That explains why the median is higher than the 50% quintile value.

  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, quantile(pf$www_likes_received, 0.95)) +
  ylim(0, quantile(pf$likes_received, 0.95)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red")
```

What's the correlation betwen the two variables? Include the top 5% of values for the variable in the calculation and round to 3 decimal places.

```{r Correlation Calcuation}
quantile(pf$likes_received, 0.95)

val <- with(pf, cor(www_likes_received, likes_received))

### Noisy Scatterplots
a. Take a guess for the correlation coefficient for the scatterplot.
0.08

b. What is the actual correlation of the two variables?
(Round to the thousandths place)
0.057

```{r Noisy Scatterplots}
round(with(Mitchell, cor(Month, Temp)),3)

### Making Sense of Data
Notes:

```{r Making Sense of Data}
range(Mitchell)

ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = Temp), data = Mitchell) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(0,203,12))
```

***

### A New Perspective

What do you notice?
Response:
That the middle of the plot appears to be less dense than on both ends.
Also the data spread appears to be quite uniform throughout the whole plot.

```{r}
install.packages('energy')
library(energy)

x <- seq(0, 4*pi, pi/20)
y <- cos(x)
qplot(x = x, y = y)
dcor.ttest(x, y)
```

head(pf)
```

### Age with Months Means

```{r Age with Months Means}
pf$age_with_months <- pf$age + round(1 - (pf$dob_month / 12),2)
```

Programming Assignment
```{r Programming Assignment}
# Create a new data frame called
# pf.fc_by_age_months that contains
# the mean friend count, the median friend
# count, and the number of users in each
# group of age_with_months. The rows of the
# data framed should be arranged in increasing
# order by the age_with_months variable.

# For example, the first two rows of the resulting
# data frame would look something like...

# age_with_months  friend_count_mean	friend_count_median	n
#              13            275.0000                   275 2
#        13.25000            133.2000                   101 11


age_with_months_groups <- group_by(pf, age_with_months)
pf.fc_by_age_months <- summarise(age_with_months_groups,
                              friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count),
                              friend_count_median = median(friend_count),
                              n = n())
pf.fc_by_age_months <- arrange(pf.fc_by_age_months, age_with_months)

head(pf.fc_by_age_months)
```

***

### Noise in Conditional Means

```{r Noise in Conditional Means}
# Create a new line plot showing friend_count_mean versus the new variable,
# age_with_months. Be sure to use the correct data frame (the one you created
# in the last exercise) AND subset the data to investigate users with ages less
# than 71.


ggplot(data= subset(pf.fc_by_age_months, age_with_months < 71), aes(x=age_with_months, y =friend_count_mean)) +
  geom_line()
```

***

### Smoothing Conditional Means
Notes:

```{r Smoothing Conditional Means}
p1 <- ggplot(data=subset(pf.fc_by_age, age<71) , aes(x= age, y = fc_mean)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()

p2 <- ggplot(data=subset(pf.fc_by_age_months, age_with_months<71), aes(x=age_with_months, y=friend_count_mean)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()

p3 <- ggplot(data=subset(pf, age < 71), aes(x=round(age/5) *5, y=friend_count)) +
      geom_line(stat='summary', fun.y = mean)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3)
```

***

### Which Plot to Choose?
Notes:
1. http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~kshedden/Courses/Stat401/Notes/401-bivariate-slides.pdf

***

### Analyzing Two Variables
Reflection:
Scatterplots are a great way to visualize the correlation between two variables.
The coefficient method is useful to show strong correlation but may missed out a lot of details as compared to using a scatterplot.
It's a good idea to visualise the same data in multiple ways to check for correlation.
Changing the bin size and data detail level can affect how smooth the plot data generated.
