## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r diamonds}
library(ggplot2) #must load the ggplot package first
data(diamonds) #loads the diamonds data set since it comes with the ggplot package

summary(diamonds)

?diamonds

summary(diamonds$color)

str(diamonds)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Create a histogram of the price of
# all the diamonds in the diamond data set.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# =======================================

summary(diamonds$price)

qplot(data=diamonds, x=price, 
      color=I('black'), fill=I('#099DD9'),
      xlab = "Price of Diamonds", ylab= "Number of Diamonds") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(300, 18820), breaks=seq(300,18820, 1000))

```

Diamond counts

```{r}
print (sum(diamonds$price < 500))

print (sum(diamonds$price < 250))

print (sum(diamonds$price >= 15000))

```

```{r}
# Explore the largest peak in the
# price histogram you created earlier.

# Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width,
# and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

# There won???t be a solution video for this
# question so go to the discussions to
# share your thoughts and discover
# what other people find.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# ======================================================================

qplot(data=diamonds, x=price, binwidth=1,
      color=I('#099DD9'), fill=I('#099DD9'),
      xlab = "Price of Diamonds", ylab= "Number of Diamonds") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(200, 18820), breaks=seq(300,18820, 500))
ggsave(filename="priceHistogram.png", width = 15, height = 12, dpi = 75, units = "in", device='png')
```

Exploring the gap in the data between 1300 and 1800

```{r}
minvalue = 1400
maxvalue = 1550

qplot(data=diamonds, x=price, color=I('black'), fill=I('orange'), binwidth=1, 
      xlab = "Price of Diamonds", ylab= "Number of Diamonds") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(minvalue, maxvalue), breaks=seq(minvalue,maxvalue, 5)) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim=c(minvalue, maxvalue))
ggsave(filename="priceGap.png", width = 30, height = 8, dpi = 75, units = "in", device='png')

```

## Doing the same exploration with the gap dataset
```{r}
# if you are interested in the data that generates the graph:
gapdata <-cut(diamonds$price, breaks = seq(1450, 1550, by = 1))

# you can view the frequency distribution using table:
table(gapdata)

```

## Exploring the max value area of the histogram

```{r}
minvalue <- 600
maxvalue <- 750
qplot(data=diamonds, x=price, color=I('black'), fill=I('orange'), binwidth=1, 
      xlab = "Price of Diamonds", ylab= "Number of Diamonds") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(minvalue, maxvalue), breaks=seq(minvalue,maxvalue, 5)) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim=c(minvalue, maxvalue))
ggsave(filename="priceMax.png", width = 30, height = 8, dpi = 75, units = "in", device='png')

```

## Exploring the max dataset further

```{r}
# if you are interested in only 'price'
newddata <- subset(diamonds, price >= 350 & price < 1000, select=c(price)) 
# if you are interested in all data for that price range:
newddata2 <- subset(diamonds, price >= 350 & price < 1000)

# if you are interested in the data that generates the graph:
cutddata <-cut(diamonds$price, breaks = seq(600, 750, by = 1))

# you can view the frequency distribution using table:
table(cutddata)

# and the mode by sorting the table data and selecting the highest frequency
names(sort(-table(cutddata)))[1]
```

```{r}
# Break out the histogram of diamond prices by cut.

# You should have five histograms in separate
# panels on your resulting plot.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# ======================================================

minvalue = 0
maxvalue = 19000
levels(diamonds$cut)

library(gridExtra)

plotdata <- function(sel_cut, color) {
    sel_data <- subset(diamonds, cut==sel_cut, select=c(price)) 
    maxvalue = max(sel_data)
    
    print (paste("Summary of cut: ",  sel_cut, sep=""))
    print (summary(sel_data))
    
    histplot <- qplot(data=sel_data, x=price, color=I('black'), fill=I(color), binwidth=300, 
          xlab = "Price of Diamonds", ylab= "Number of Diamonds") +
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(minvalue, maxvalue), breaks=seq(minvalue,maxvalue, 1000)) 
    
    return (histplot)
}

fair_plot <- plotdata("Fair","orange")
good_plot <- plotdata("Good","blue")
verygood_plot <- plotdata("Very Good","green")
premium_plot <- plotdata("Premium","brown")
ideal_plot <- plotdata("Ideal","red")

grid.arrange(fair_plot, good_plot, verygood_plot, premium_plot, ideal_plot, ncol=1)

```

## Alternative solution

# Notes
1. http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Facets_(ggplot2)/

```{r}
minvalue = 0
maxvalue = 19000
qplot(data=diamonds, x=price, color=I('black'), fill=I("blue"), binwidth=300, 
          xlab = "Price of Diamonds", ylab= "Number of Diamonds") +
        facet_wrap(~cut)
```



```{r}
# In the two last exercises, we looked at
# the distribution for diamonds by cut.

# Run the code below in R Studio to generate
# the histogram as a reminder.

# ===============================================================

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut)
```


```{r}
# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut,  scales="free_y")
```


```{r}
# Create a histogram of price per carat
# and facet it by cut. You can make adjustments
# to the code from the previous exercise to get
# started.

# Adjust the bin width and transform the scale
# of the x-axis using log10.

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE.
# ===========================================================================

qplot(x = log10(price), data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut,  scales="free_y")
```

## alternative solution
```{r}
qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth=0.01) +
facet_wrap(~cut,  scales="free_y") +
    scale_x_log10()
```



```{r}
# Investigate the price of diamonds using box plots,
# numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical
# variables: cut, clarity, or color.

# There won???t be a solution video for this
# exercise so go to the discussion thread for either
# BOXPLOTS BY CLARITY, BOXPLOT BY COLOR, or BOXPLOTS BY CUT
# to share you thoughts and to
# see what other people found.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.
# =================================================================


qplot(x = color, y= price, data = diamonds, geom = "boxplot")
ggsave(filename="priceColorBoxplot.png", width = 15, height = 4, dpi = 75, units = "in", device='png')

tapply(diamonds$price, diamonds$color, summary)
```

## Analysis
1. Suprisingly the color which are worst off is actually more expensive than better colors, the median price for colors, H, I and J was higher than the rest of the colors. 

```{r}
IQR(subset(diamonds, color == "D")$price)

IQR(subset(diamonds, color == "J")$price)
```

```{r}
# Investigate the price per carat of diamonds across
# the different colors of diamonds using boxplots.

# Go to the discussions to
# share your thoughts and to discover
# what other people found.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.

# SUBMIT YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
# ===================================================================
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color, y= price/carat, fill=color)) +
            geom_boxplot()
ggsave(filename="pricePerCaratColorBoxplot.png", width = 15, height = 4, dpi = 75, units = "in", device='png')

tapply(diamonds$price/diamonds$carat, diamonds$color, summary)
```


## Analysis
1. When the boxplot are rescaled to show price per carat, we can see a closer distribution range against all colors. However we are still able to observe a higher median price for the worst off colors from H to J.
1. We also notice that the best colors range from D to G, has a wider outlier prices.

## Carat Freq Polygon

```{r}
qplot(data=diamonds, x=carat, color=carat, geom="freqpoly", binwidth=0.01) +
 scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.1,2.2), breaks = seq(0.1, 2.2, 0.1))

```

## Using the dataset from Adults with HIV (%, age 15-49) - save the first sheet as csv file to begin
data <- read.csv('data.csv', header = T, row.names = 1, check.names = F)
df <- as.data.frame(t(data))

## find the top five countries with the worst HIV rate
country_max_val <- apply(df, 2, mean, na.rm=T)
print ("Top 5 worst countries:")
head(sort(country_max_val, T), 5)
print ("Top 5 best countries:")
head(sort(country_max_val, F), 5)

}

plotLineChart <- function(dat, outputfilename) {

    ggplot(aes(y=Count,x=years,group=Country),data=dat)+
        geom_line(aes(color=Country))+
        geom_point(aes(color=Country))+
        scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1979,2011))+

}

worstdata <- select(df, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia)
worstdata$years <- 1979:2011
worstdata<-gather(worstdata,'Country','Count',1:5)

plotLineChart(worstdata)
saveChartAsPng("HivWorstOverTime.png")

bestdata <- select(df, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Croatia, `Czech Republic`)
bestdata$years <- 1979:2011
bestdata<-gather(bestdata,'Country','Count',1:5)
plotLineChart(bestdata)
saveChartAsPng("HivBestOverTime.png")

#summary(data)
```

## Analysis over time
1. It appears that the top three country that is getting it worst are Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho.
1. And out of these three countries, it would appears the situation in Swaziland is getting worst.
1. Whereas Zambia is showing a steady decline and the situation in Zimbabwe has improved a lot with a sharp drop.

## Questions Adults with HIV (%, age 15-49)
1. Which country has the worst percentage?
1. Which country has the best percentage?

```{r}

plotBoxPlot <- function(dat){
    ggplot(dat, aes(x = Country, y= Count, fill= Country)) +
            geom_boxplot() +
            xlab('Country')+
            ylab('Estimated HIV Prevalence% - (Ages 15-49)')+
            ggtitle('Prevalence of HIV Per Country')
}

plotBoxPlot(worstdata)
saveChartAsPng("WorstHivPerCountry.png")

plotBoxPlot(bestdata)
saveChartAsPng("BestHivPerCountry.png")

```

## Analysis by Country
1. Just as what we saw in the time series chart, the top three worst countries is showing a higher median value as well as a wider spread of values in the HIV%.
1. Zambia which have been showing a steady decline has a very narrow spread of values.
1. Zimbabwe that is showing a sharp decline in the HIV% has a lower media but is still showing high values in terms of the HIV% range.

## Additional reference
1. Swaziland had it worst due to the cultural norm regarding sexuality and a financial crisis https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/11/aids-ignorance-swaziland-struggles-funds
1. During roughly the same period, Zimbabwe has seen success with it's AIDS levy to increase domestic resources for the national HIV programme, which have supported the prevention and treatment of HIV services to the local community. http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2012/may/20120528fszimbabwe

```{r}
qplot(x = Count, data = worstdata, fill=Country) + facet_wrap(~Country) 

qplot(x = Count, data = worstdata, fill=Country) + facet_wrap(~Country) +
    scale_x_log10()

```

## Data source
1. By exporting all the birthday events from Facebook and importing the URL into Apple Calendar app.
1. Proceed to export the ical file from the Calendar app.
1. Next step is to use this free online too, ics2csv, to convert the ical file to csv.

# Your task is to investigate the distribution of your friends'
# birth months and days.

# Here some questions you could answer, and we hope you think of others.

# **********************************************************************

# How many people share your birthday? Do you know them?
# (Reserve time with them or save money to buy them a gift!)

# Which month contains the most number of birthdays?

# How many birthdays are in each month?

# Which day of the year has the most number of birthdays?

# Do you have at least 365 friends that have birthdays on everyday
# of the year?

# **********************************************************************

# You will need to do some data munging and additional research to
# complete this task. This task won't be easy, and you may encounter some
# unexpected challenges along the way. We hope you learn a lot from it though.

# You can expect to spend 30 min or more on this task depending if you
# use the provided data or obtain your personal data. We also encourage you
# to use the lubridate package for working with dates. Read over the documentation
# in RStudio and search for examples online if you need help.

# You'll need to export your Facebooks friends' birthdays to a csv file.
# You may need to create a calendar of your Facebook friends??? birthdays
# in a program like Outlook or Gmail and then export the calendar as a
# csv file.

# Once you load the data into R Studio, you can use the strptime() function
# to extract the birth months and birth days. We recommend looking up the
# documentation for the function and finding examples online.

# We've included some links in the Instructor Notes to help get you started.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions
# that includes:
#   1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
#   2. snippets of code that created the plots
#   3. links to the images of your plots
